The format of the experiment is as follows.

1. A cross will appear on the screen. Press any button to start.

2. You'll hear the beginning of the sentence you're supposed to complete.

3. When the sentence is done, you can press "R" if you'd like to hear it again.

4. When you're ready to complete the sentence, press "U". Then just speak the full sentence, with your completion, out loud.
